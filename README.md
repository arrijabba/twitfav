css file for fav

1. This only works for firefox (chrome is trash and doesnt allow user styles natively)
2. Hit Alt, if the "File | Edit | etc" menu isnt up
3. Help > Troubleshoting Information > Under Application Basics, click "Show Folder" next to Profile Folder
4. Make a new folder called "chrome" in this directory
5. Put "userChrome.css" in there
6. Profit
